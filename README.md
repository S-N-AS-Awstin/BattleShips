## About
This is from an open ended project from highschool, the criteria being to
make whatever program you wished, so long as it used the *Apache Netbeans* IDE
and, of course, use the *JavaScript Programing language*.

Provided is a Zip file with all the needed content, and a data file, with
the source code and all assets available for view.

## Downloading
1. Download the BattleShips zip file and unzip in desired directory
2. Enter the unzipped folder, Go to "dist" and run the .jar file. This will run the application

## Viewing Content (Source code and Assets)
This project has all of its assets and scripts in the SRC file. At this point in time they are unorganized.
The projects main scripts are: BattleshipAI.java, and Coordinates.java, which handles game logic. The rest handle GUI elements

## Requirements
- Java Platform SE or any Java Runtime Environment to run the .jar file

### TODO:
- Clean and Organize the source files
- Rebuild and repackage the zip file
